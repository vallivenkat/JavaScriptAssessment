I felt that this project is very challenging.
First , when I was generating the fields with holes, I found it very difficult comparing percentage and probability.I managed to solve it after reading some useful links provided. I got so many errors here and there as well. I also found setting  the hat location was hard, but using the npm example codes i  managed to do it.



With the use of Kick Starter and npm Example and some of the useful links provided I can manage to finish this Project.
